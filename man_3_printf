.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH LIBRARY
.B Standard C library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR _printf ()
function outputs to the stdout according to the format string. To reduce the number of times the write function is called, and therefore optimize performance, a local buffer of 1024 characters is used.
.SS Format of the format string
The format string is composed of zero or more directives\(emordinary characters (not %) that are copied unchanged to stdout and conversion specifiers that tell
.BR _printf ()
how to handle the variadic list of arguments. The
.BR get_printer ()
function handles each format specifier in the format string and returns a function pointer to the appropriate function to handle the type defined by the specifier.
.PP
Each function returned by the
.BR get_printer ()
function will take the va_list as an argument and use the
.BR _putchar ()
function to print to the stdout. All of these functions return their length to
.BR _printf ()
so the total length can be counted and returned at the end of the
.BR _printf ()
function.
.SS FLAG CHARACTERS
One or more of the following flag characters may appear after the % character to modify the conversion behavior:
.TP
.B +
A sign (+ or \-) should always be placed before a number produced by a signed conversion. Applies to d and i conversions.
.TP
.B ' '
(a space) If no sign is going to be written, a blank space is inserted before the value. This flag is ignored if the + flag is present. Applies to d and i conversions.
.TP
.B #
The value should be converted to an "alternate form". For
.B o
conversions, the first character of the output string is made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already). For
.B x
and
.B X
conversions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions) prepended to it.
.SS CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
Each conversion specifier is introduced by the character % and ends with the conversion specifier. They define the type of conversion to be applied.
.TP
.B c
Prints a single character
.TP
.B s
Prints each character in array until null terminator is reached
.TP
.B S
Prints a string with non-printable characters represented as \\x followed by the ASCII code in hexadecimal (uppercase, 2 characters)
.TP
.BR d ", " i
Converts the integer argument to signed decimal notation and prints it
.TP
.B b
Converts the integer value to its binary representation without leading zeros and prints it
.TP
.B p
Converts the pointer value (memory address) to hexadecimal and prints it
.TP
.B %
A '%' character is printed. No argument is converted
.TP
.B u
Converts the unsigned integer argument to unsigned decimal notation and prints it
.TP
.B o
Converts the unsigned integer argument to unsigned octal notation and prints it
.TP
.B x
Converts the unsigned integer argument to unsigned hexadecimal notation (lowercase) and prints it
.TP
.B X
Converts the unsigned integer argument to unsigned hexadecimal notation (uppercase) and prints it
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful return, these functions return the number of bytes printed (excluding the null terminator at the end of strings).
.PP
On error, \-1 is returned.
